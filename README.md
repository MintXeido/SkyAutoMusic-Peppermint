## Development Limitations

### Why macOS support is limited

Sky is currently unavailable for Intel-based Macs, which limits development for macOS. While Sky Lush aims to support macOS in addition to Windows, the game only runs on Apple Silicon Macs (M-series chips). Unfortunately, as I work on an Intel-based Mac, I am unable to further research or develop macOS support. Thank you for your understanding!
