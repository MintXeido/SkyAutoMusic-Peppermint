## Overview

**Sky Auto Music (Peppermint)** is an improved version of the original **Sky Auto Music**. It retains the same convenient tools while introducing:
- A more user-friendly experience
- A redesigned user interface
- Multi-language support
- Additional features

This version automates the process of playing songs in the game *Sky: Children of the Light* for a smoother, more enjoyable experience.

## Development Limitations

### Why macOS support is limited

Sky is currently unavailable for Intel-based Macs, which limits development for macOS. While Sky Auto Music (Peppermint) aims to support macOS in addition to Windows, the game only runs on Apple Silicon Macs (M-series chips). Unfortunately, as I work on an Intel-based Mac, I am unable to further research or develop macOS support. Thank you for your understanding!
